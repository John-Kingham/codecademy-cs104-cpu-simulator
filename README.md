# Codecademy CS104 Portfolio Project - CPU Simulator
Part of the [Codecademy Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science). 

In this project, I will research, design, and build a Python program that simulates the functionalities of a CPU, cache and memory bus.
## Software Requirements
### Software Product Requirements
#### Functional Requirements
The program should:
- Simulate the basic functionalities of a CPU, cache, and memory bus
- Fetch and parse instructions from an input file
- Fetch and parse initialization values for the Memory Bus from a separate input file
- Send CPU instructions and initial Memory Bus values to the CPU and Memory Bus, respectively
- Provide console output to the user documenting the stages of input processing
- Implement an instruction set architecture that can handle the following MIPS Instructions: ADD, ADDI, SUB, SLT, BNE, J, JAL, LW, SW, CACHE, HALT
#### Nonfunctional Requirements
##### Technology Constraints
The program should:
- Be written in Python 3
- Use object oriented programming
##### Service Quality Constraints
- None
### Software Project Requirements
- Use Git and GitHub for version control
